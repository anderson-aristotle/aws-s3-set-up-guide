# Simple Storage Service on Amazon Web Services setup

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository.

Read over all the instructions before proceeding.

Follow the steps outlined to create and gain programmatic access to an AWS S3
 bucket.

## Prerequisites

-   An `AWS` _(Amazon Web Services)_ account
-   A Credit card is required to verify your AWS account.

If you do not have an account, open [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click
 `Create a Free Account`.
Amazon provides a [free tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/),
 with some limitations, for twelve months after you sign-up for an AWS account.

## Motivation

Storing large static files is a common need for a web application.
Accepting image uploads from authorized users but allowing public read access is
 a frequent example.

AWS provides a variety of APIs, one of which is easily used for this purpose.
This guide helps ensure access to these APIs is restricted.

Why is the important?

Using any metered API has financial risks.  Using many APIs may have data risks
 (information loss or exposure).

Using restrictive access control with AWS ensures that even if an identity is
 compromised, the actual risks, financial and otherwise, are limited.

## AWS S3 access control

1.  Open the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/) in your
 browser
1.  From the `AWS` console, select `All Services`, and open tabs for
 `IAM` _(Identity and Access Management)_ and `S3` _(Simple Storage Service)_.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Identities are how we grant access to AWS APIs.

In the [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) tab:


1.  Select `Users` in the left sidebar.
1.  Click `Add User` near the top of the page.
1.  Enter `wdi-upload` into the `User name` text box.
1.  Under access type, check `Programmatic Access`
1.  Click Next
1.  Highlight Add User to Group if it isn't already highlighted.
1.  Click Next
1.  Click create User
_Then_
1.  Click `Close`.
1.  Click on your newly created user: `wdi-upload`.
1.  Click on the security credentials tab.
1.  Look for the `Access Keys` section
  1.  Click the small `x` to the right of your existing access key to delete it.
  1.  Confirm the deletion of the access key.
1.  Click `Create access key`
1.  When complete, click `download .csv file` and move the CSV file to this repository. (this is
the only time you'll be able to see your access key, but you can generate a new one anytime
and are encouraged to rotate them frequently)
1.  Click `Close`
1. You should still be in the page for the `wdi-upload` user. If not you can select `Users` on the left sidebar and click on `wdi-upload` again to be on that user's page again.
1.  Copy the `User ARN` _(Amazon Resource Name)_ at the top of the page and save it in the [arn.txt](arn.txt) in this repo. The ARN should start with `arn` and end with `wdi-upload`.

We'll need the User ARN to grant access to an S3 bucket we'll use for uploads.
We'll also need an `Access Key` _(Access Key Id and Secret Access Key)_ for this IAM User to upload files via the S3 API.
The Access Key is contained in credentials.csv.

**Note well:** credentials.csv contains `secrets`!
Do not share them or store them in git.
The [.gitignore](.gitignore) in this repository explicitly ignores this file. Altering the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file
in this repository could result in your AWS credentials (credentials linked to *your* credit card information) being visible on Github. *NEVER COMMIT SECRETS TO GIT*

### Simple Storage Service (S3)

S3 stores files you upload in `buckets`.  A bucket is a top-level namespace
 for your files.

In the [S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3) tab:

1.  Click `Create Bucket`.
 This opens the `Create bucket` modal.
1.  Enter a name in the `Bucket Name` box. It must be unique among all S3 buckets and in all lowercase characters.
1.  Select `US East (N. Virginia)` for the `Region`.
1.  Click `Create`.
1.  Click your new bucket and select the `Permissions` tab.
1.  Click `Bucket Policy`.
1.  At the bottom of the `Bucket Policy Editor` page,
 click `Policy Generator`.  This opens the AWS Policy Generator page.
1.  On the AWS Policy Generator page

    1.  Step 1: Select Policy Type

        1.  For `Select Type of Policy` use `S3 Bucket Policy`.

    1.  Step 2: Add Statement(s)

        1.  Select `Allow` for `Effect`.
        1.  Paste the User ARN into the `Principal` box.
        1.  Select `PutObject` and `PutObjectAcl` for `Actions`.
        1.  Enter `arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*` into the
          `Amazon Resource Name (ARN)` box.
        1.  Click the `Add Statement`.

    1.  Step 3: Generate Policy

        1.  Click `Generate Policy`
        1.  Copy the JSON from the `Policy JSON Document` modal.
        1.  Close the modal.
        1.  Close the Policy Generator tab.

1.  Return to the S3 tab.
1.  Paste the bucket policy into the `Bucket Policy Editor` field.
1.  Click `Save`.

You have now created and granted access to an S3 bucket.

These steps limit upload access to one bucket for the identity `wdi-upload`.

This is one specific and restrictive way of implementing access control.
AWS provides many different mechanisms to grant and restrict access.

#### Example bucket policy JSON

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy1439826519004",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1439826516658",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS Account Id>:user/<IAM User Name>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
